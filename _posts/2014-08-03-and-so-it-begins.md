So I've decided to start a blog. And make a person page. And start a commit streak. I haven't the faintest idea how well this is going to go, especially once the semester starts and classes become my primary focus, but until then, we'll see how it goes. 

I haven't decided exactly what this is going to be about. My work with Beluga as a research programmer? My life as a student at McGill? Whatever projects I start or work I can get? Even lifting and dieting perhaps? Or maybe a combination of everthing. As for the name, I have no idea. I'm a software engineer, I'm in Canada, and it makes sense as the moment.
